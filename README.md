# fortran_terrain_itm

This repository contains a collection of tools for manipulating BIL terrain files and some plubming to connect to the Irregular Terrain Model (aka. Longley-Rice) for radio propagation. 

Note: this is all very hackish at best.  Beware.

Longley-Rice code from Mike Markowski [https://udel.edu/~mm/itm/]
